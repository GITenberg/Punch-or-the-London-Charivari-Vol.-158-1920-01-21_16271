<h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>

  <p>We understand that the Frenchman who lost his temper so completely
  during a duel with pistols that he threatened to shoot his opponent will
  be suspended from taking part in similar encounters for the next six
  months.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A man who had half a ton of coal delivered to him without warning has
  been removed to an asylum, where he is being treated for coal-shock.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Wrexham Education Committee has decided not to have Welsh taught in
  the elementary schools. Doubts have recently arisen, it appears, as to
  whether it will ever be the chosen medium of communication in the League
  of Nations.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>"There is a movement on foot," says <i>The Daily Mail</i>, "to
  brighten the dress of boys." Smith Tertius writes to say that, according
  to the best opinion in his set, the waist should be worn fuller and less
  attention paid to the "sit" of the shirt.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A man recently arrested in Dublin was found to have in his possession
  a loaded revolver, three sticks of gelignite, four lengths of fuse, a
  number of detonators and a jemmy. It is thought that he may have been
  dabbling in politics.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>"Demobilised men are doing such execution at the London World's Fair
  Shooting Galleries," says a news item, "that the supply of bottles is
  running short." Nothing, however, can be done about it till the <font
  class="sc">Prime Minister</font> returns from Paris.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>"There is a proper time for the last meal of the day," says a medical
  writer. We have always been of the opinion that supper should not be
  taken between meals.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>After addressing a meeting for two hours, says a contemporary, <font
  class="sc">Trotsky</font> fainted. A more humane man would have fainted
  first.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>We feel very jealous of the suburban gentleman who wrote last week
  asking what an O.B.E. was, and whether, if it was a bird, it should be
  fed on hemp-seed or ants' eggs.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>With reference to the wooden house which fell down last week, the
  builder is of the opinion that a sparrow must have accidentally stepped
  on it.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Lord <font class="sc">Birkenhead</font> describes the Coalition as an
  "invertebrate and undefined body." Meaning that they have rather more
  wishbone than backbone.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>An Indian native was recently sentenced to write a poem. In other
  countries of course you commit a poem first and are sentenced
  afterwards.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Mr. <font class="sc">F.H. Rose</font>, M.P., writing in <i>The Sunday
  Pictorial</i>, refers to the Ministry of Munitions as "a veritable
  monument of superfluous futility." For ourselves we don't mind futility
  so long as it isn't superfluous.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Will the lady who, during the Winter Sales' scramble, inadvertently
  went off with two husbands please return the other one to his rightful
  owner?</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Mr. <font class="sc">J.H. Symons</font>, the Weymouth draper novelist,
  has told a <i>Star</i> reporter that he only writes novels for a hobby.
  This sets him apart from the many who do it with malicious intent.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A referee has lodged a complaint against the Football Club on whose
  ground he was assaulted by several spectators who disagreed with his
  decisions. Although sympathising with him we fear his attempt to rob our
  national game of its most sporting element will not meet with general
  approval.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>It is generally expected that, owing to the number of deaths from
  whisky poisoning which have occurred of late, America may decide to go
  dry again.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>It is reported on good authority that Mr. <font class="sc">C.B.
  Cochran</font> will visit America daily until the signature of <font
  class="sc">Dempsey's</font> manager is obtained.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p><font class="sc">Lenin</font>, says a contemporary, has completed his
  plans for the overthrow of civilisation. It seems that all our efforts to
  conceal from him its presence in our midst are doomed to failure.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>"A search for combined beauty and brains," says <i>The Daily Mail</i>,
  "has been instituted by <i>The Weekly Dispatch</i>." We gather, however,
  that a good circulation will also be taken into consideration.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>According to the Technical Secretary of the Civil Aviation Committee a
  vehicle has been designed which is equally at home in the air, on land,
  on the water and under it. It is said to be distinguishable from Mr.
  <font class="sc">Winston Churchill</font> only by the latter's
  eloquence.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>We understand that certain members of the betting classes have
  demanded that the starting price for coal should be published each day in
  the early evening papers.</p>

<h2>OUR BALLYBUN LOTTERY.</h2>

  <blockquote>
  <p>[<i>À propos</i> of Premium Bonds it has been recalled that in his
  evidence, given some years ago before a Select Committee, the then
  Under-Secretary for Ireland stated that in that distressful country
  "lotteries are very much used for religious purposes by people of all
  denominations," and that "it would be flying in the face of public
  opinion, especially of the great religious bodies, to interfere with
  them."]</p>

  </blockquote>
  <p>Murphy has given up charity for ever. He was perhaps fuller of this
  virtue than any other body in Ballybun, and his house was packed with
  things he had won at raffles. When a brick tore a hole in the Orange drum
  our Presbyterian pastor at once got up a bazaar for repairs to the
  chapel, and Murphy won the finest silver tea-service this side of the
  Aran Islands. Murphy knew no distinctions of race, creed or sex in the
  holy cause of charity. When our Methodist minister, who is universally
  popular, as his knowledge of a horse would be a credit to any
  denomination, got up an Auction Bridge Drive in aid of the Anti-Gambling
  League, Murphy came home with three pink antimacassars, a discourse by
  <font class="sc">Jeremy Taylor</font> and two months' pay out of the
  pocket of McDougal, the organist, who seems to play cards by ear. But
  Nemesis was lying in ambush for Murphy.</p>

  <p>Three old ladies in Trim decided to get up a Tombola for the poor this
  winter, and of course they sent Murphy a sheaf of tickets. As lotteries
  are illegal they, being pious, hated them; anyway they decided to call it
  a Tombola. They got the whole of Ireland to send them prizes, articles of
  vertu and bric-à-brac, and any other old things that are of no use to
  anybody, The carriage on the stuff and the printer's bill nearly ruined
  the charitable ladies, but, as they said, the Tombola would pay all the
  expenses, and if they could knock any more out of it the poor should have
  it.</p>

  <p>If you sold a dozen tickets you could keep the thirteenth for
  yourself, and as Murphy, on account of his charity, was so popular he
  must have sold hundreds. People seemed to have an idea that the raffle
  was for a gondola, and they thought it would look beautiful on the pond
  in front of the Town Hall. Unfortunately our local poetess confirmed this
  error by writing a poem about it called "Italy in Ireland," which was
  produced in <i>The Ballybun Binnacle</i>, with a misprint about the
  gondolier's "untanned sole," which caused a fracas in the editorial
  office.</p>

  <p>Murphy explained to all concerned that perhaps his Italian was rusty,
  and anyway his time was so taken up reading lottery-tickets and other
  charitable literature that he never knew what it was all for. It was a
  Tombola, however, this time, and not a gondola, they were subscribing
  for. It was a kind of Italian lottery which the police didn't mind
  because the prizes were not in money or anything of value, but just Old
  Masters and brick-bracks. Murphy has such a way with him that the editor
  and the poetess each took a dozen tickets.</p>

  <p>When the result of the draw was published Murphy won six prizes, but
  no one grudged him them as he had taken so much trouble. The Grand Prize,
  a "statue carved by an Italian artist, the finest bit of sculpture ever
  seen in Ireland," was won by our popular grocer, Mr. McAroon. We were all
  delighted. People trooped in crowds to McAroon's back-door after
  closing-time to toll him so. The police took their names, but the
  magistrates, who have a great respect for the fine arts, said that this
  was a day in the artistic development of the Cinderella of the West which
  automatically and <i>primâ facie</i> regularised an extension of
  closing-hours.</p>

  <p>McAroon said that his religion did not run much to statues, but that,
  to show his tolerance to all denominations, especially to those on his
  books, he would have it unveiled by his Minister. He would invite the
  Bishop and all men of goodwill to be present at the ceremony. He would
  place it in the corner of his garden overlooking the esplanade, where it
  would cheer the simple mariners coming home after their arduous fishing
  toils, and perhaps remind one or two of them (but he would mention no
  names) of a dozen or so of porter that had been left unpaid for after a
  recent wedding.</p>

  <p>The Ballybun express carries no goods whatever, except with the
  connivance of the guard and driver, who are both very decent Ballybun
  boys, and will bring anything down from Dublin for anyone. They promised
  to carry the statue themselves from the railway station up to McAroon's
  house. If the express was less than three hours late, which it was sure
  to be if it was running smoothly, they could just beam-end the statue on
  its pedestal and the presiding elder could unveil it with a hammer.</p>

  <p>The train was not too late, just punctually late, and the guard had
  time to hurry the statue along through the biggest crowd we have had for
  years in Ballybun.</p>

  <p>The Minister said that he would not open the case with prayer, because
  it might give offence to friends of other Christian denominations; he
  would just knock the front off and let this matchless piece of statuary
  from the blue skies of Italy dazzle them with its beauty. It needed no
  words from him, but he would just like to remind any of his flock present
  that the collection next Sunday was for the heathen both at home and
  abroad.</p>

  <p>The statue then flashed out on us and left us breathless.</p>

  <p>It was the most scandalous thing ever seen in Ballybun; it was Venus
  rising from the sea without a stitch. There <span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page44" id="page44"></a>[pg 44]</span> she stood with one hand
  raised toward the sky and the other pointing at the backs of all the
  pious people in Ballybun as they hurried indignantly home. Some of them
  blamed McAroon, while others said that Murphy knew all the time what a
  Tombola really was and that he ought to be ashamed of himself.</p>

  <p>The Bishop ordered his people not to deal at McAroon's until Murphy
  had removed the scandalous object. So many bitter things were said that
  McAroon, who is obstinate when roused, vowed that as long as the sun
  shone in heaven the lady should add lustre to his back-yard. The Minister
  however tried to move him to a more prayerful spirit.</p>

  <p>McAroon said it wouldn't be right to smash up for firewood a marble
  statue that had cost five hundred pounds if a penny. The clergyman said
  that if everybody stopped away from his store he would lose more than
  that in a year, and that in any case, if McAroon suffered, he would
  suffer in the holy cause of charity.</p>

  <p>McAroon's piety was touched, and he said that in the interests of
  peace and holy charity he would agree on a compromise. He had forsooth to
  keep his vow and let the lady stop, but she had two outstretched arms and
  there was always abundance of family washing on hand in the daytime at
  all events. The clergy of all denominations agreed that his decision was
  in keeping with the best traditions of a Family Grocer.</p>

  <p>Murphy and McAroon made it up publicly. Murphy asked how anyone in
  Ballybun could possibly know the Italian bathing regulations. Italy was a
  godless country; but "anyway," said he, "hear you me. I have suffered so
  much in mind from this that I have done with charity for ever."</p>

  <p>Christian peace and friendship reign once more in Ballybun; but any
  visitor who desires to see the beauties of Spagnoletti's famous
  masterpiece (what McAroon calls his "Anna Dryomeny") without the washing
  to serve as a veil must come by night and bring his own matches.</p>

  <p>"Of course, my swaggering buccaneer, if you want to do it in the grand
  manner," answered Frederick, "I'll arrange for the saucy little cutter,
  the sequestered cove an' the hard-riding exciseman with a cocked hat and
  cutlass. But the simpler if less picturesque way is to dump your bag on
  the counter at the Customs House and be taken with a fit of sneezing when
  the Grand Inquisitor asks you if you have anything to declare."</p>

  <p>"Whereupon he'll hand me a quinine tablet and, when I show signs of
  convalescence, repeat the question in a loud voice. And if I don't know
  the correct answer I'll find myself meditating in Portland or
  Pentonville. That's what I'm exposing myself to by obliging corrupt an'
  unscrupulous friends," continued Percival bitterly.</p>

  <p>"Hang it!" expostulated Frederick, "the potty little bottle of scent
  I'm asking you to deliver to my cousin Julia won't get you more than a
  seven-days' stretch. And you've got <i>fourteen</i> days' leave."</p>

  <p>"Well, I won't grumble about that, although I'd arranged my programme
  differently. But what about the box of Flor Fantomas I'm taking for the
  Major, and the bottle of whisky with which the skipper has entrusted me
  for the purpose of propitiating his projected father-in-law, to say
  nothing of the piece of Brussels lace which Binnie says is for his aunt.
  Their combined weight will just about earn me a lifer. I can see me
  wiring the War Office for an extension of leave on urgent business
  grounds&mdash;nature of business, to enable applicant to complete term of
  penal servitude."</p>

  <p>"Don't, Percival, old crumpet," murmured Frederick, visibly affected;
  "the thought of you languishing in a felon's cell, without cigarettes,
  gives me a pain in my heart. Let me see what I can do for you."</p>

  <p>In a few minutes he was back, beaming. "I've fixed it all right,
  <i>mon lapin</i>," he said; "if the worst comes to the worst they'll bail
  you out with the Mess funds. But they won't accept further
  responsibility. The Major says, if a fellow who's spent his whole career
  dodging duties can't dodge the duty on a box of cigars he doesn't deserve
  sympathy."</p>

  <p>So Percival proceeded on leave with a heavy bag and a heavier
  conscience. On the boat he was greeted hilariously by Gillow the gunner
  and Sparkes the sapper, who invited him below to drink success to the
  voyage. In order to give the voyage no chance of failure they continued
  to drink success to it until the vessel backed into Folkestone Harbour,
  when they felt their precautions might be relaxed.</p>

  <p>"Thanks to our efforts we've arrived safely," said Gillow as they
  strolled up on deck; "but the sight of jolly old England doesn't seem to
  be moving you to mirth and song, Percival. Why this outward-bound
  expression when we're on the homeward tack, my hearty?"</p>

  <p>"It's the gnawing molar of conscience," said Percival ruefully; "I've
  got a consignment of pink-ribboned parcels in my bag which I know to
  contain contraband and which I also suspect&mdash;Frederick's and
  Binnie's <span class="pagenum"><a name="page46" id="page46"></a>[pg
  46]</span> anyway&mdash;to contain amorous missives not meant for vulgar
  eyes. If I deliver the parcels with the seals broken I shall get the
  glacial glare from the damsels concerned, and when I get back scorpions
  and poisoned bill-hooks will be too good for poor Percival."</p>

  <p>"Phew!" whistled Sparkes. "They go through your baggage with a fine
  toothcomb nowadays. Couldn't you drop over the side with your bag and
  drift ashore on a deserted beach, disguised as a floating mine?"</p>

  <p>"I've cut impersonations of hardware out of my <i>répertoire</i> since
  the day I failed to get past an R.T.O. disguised as a brass-hat," said
  Percival sadly. "I suppose I must fall back on direct action. I've a
  feeling that England expects every man this day to pay his duty."</p>

  <p>On the quay there was the usual mad charge of porters. Percival
  indicated his bag to one of them with a distracted air, and followed him
  to the Customs House guiltily. The porter dumped the bag before an
  official, who had a piece of chalk hopefully poised between his
  fingers.</p>

  <p>"'Nything t' 'clare?" he asked, preparing to affix the sign which
  spelt freedom.</p>

  <p>Percival blew his nose violently, hoping the chalk would descend to
  save him the necessity of answering, but it remained poised in
  mid-air.</p>

  <p>"Anything to declare?" repeated the official, with emphasis.</p>

  <p>"Er," said Percival weakly&mdash;"nothing that you need worry
  about&mdash;only a few presents."</p>

  <p>"I'll have to trouble you for your keys, then," said the
  incorruptible.</p>

  <p>Percival sighed dismally and produced them. Suddenly he noticed Gillow
  declaring his baggage, and became so interested that he failed to
  perceive that the official was in difficulties with the lock of his
  bag.</p>

  <p>"This the right key, Sir?" demanded the latter at length.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes," said Percival absently. "But perhaps the bag isn't
  locked."</p>

  <p>The bag wasn't. It opened easily, and the official plunged into a
  welter of articles of personal use; but no parcels or dutiable goods came
  to light.</p>

  <p>"P'raps you think it's a joke, wasting my time like this," snorted the
  official indignantly. "All I can say is, it's an infernal bad one."</p>

  <p>"Awf'lly sorry," said Percival sweetly, as his eye followed Gillow,
  who had emerged unchallenged. "I must have forgotten to bring the parcels
  I spoke about."</p>

  <p>Smiling cheerfully, he directed the porter to place his bag by the
  side of Gillow's in a Pullman, and took his seat with an expression of
  complete content.</p>

  <p>"How fares the master criminal?" asked Sparkes.</p>

  <p>"A sympathetic friend took my troubles on his shoulders," said
  Percival, "and got the parcels through with an effrontery which amazed
  me. I always took him for an upright youth, too."</p>

  <p>"Who was it?" asked Gillow.</p>

  <p>"You! Didn't you notice you took my bag by mistake? But don't let it
  weigh unduly on your conscience. Mine's clear anyway, and I feel that my
  troubles are over."</p>

  <p>But it was not till he got home and opened his own bag that he
  discovered a quantity of broken glass, a pungent odour of whisky and
  Cologne water, a discoloured parcel of lace and a box of sodden
  cigars.</p>

  <p>"I was never meant for a smuggler," he groaned.</p>

<h2>BILLIARDS.</h2>

<p class="center"><font class="sc">Herbert <i>v.</i> James.</font></p>

  <p>This match of a hundred up was played in the handsome saloon of the
  "Leadswingers' Arms" yesterday afternoon before an unusually dense crowd,
  who both came in just too late to secure the table. It is understood that
  the game was arranged as the result of a heated discussion during lunch
  the same day, in the course of which Herbert had the effrontery to tell
  me&mdash;I mean, to tell James&mdash;that what I&mdash;that is,
  he&mdash;knew about billiards wouldn't cover the pyramid-spot. James, who
  some hours later thought of a perfectly priceless repartee, which he has
  since forgotten, replied with dignity by challenging the other to an
  immediate game. Herbert accepted and, hastily finishing their lunch, the
  two repaired to the nearest billiard-room.</p>

  <p>"I'm not due back at the office for another twenty minutes, so we've
  tons of time," observed Herbert airily as they entered.</p>

  <p>James looked at him, but said nothing. He had the better of the
  opening man&#339;uvres, however, for he secured the only cue that
  possessed a non-flexible tip; Herbert's was at the best of the semi-rigid
  type, a fact which impelled him to declare that the place would soon
  resemble a popular tea-shop. Not being pressed for an elucidation of this
  remark, he volunteered one. "No tips," he explained as he tenderly
  chalked his.</p>

  <p>Herbert won the toss and elected to break with spot, which appeared to
  be a rounder ball than its fellow. Taking a careful and protracted aim at
  the red, he only missed the object-ball by inches, his own travelling
  twice round the table before finally coming to rest in baulk.</p>

  <p>"Now then, Inman," he said, with a poor attempt at jauntiness, "score
  off that if you can."</p>

  <p>James's reply was a calculated safety-miss, which only failed of its
  intention in that it left his ball about an inch away from the middle
  pocket. The closeness of the contest may be gauged from the fact that at
  this stage the game was called (or would have been called if the marker
  had not gone out to his dinner) at one all.</p>

  <p>"In off the white," declared Herbert, and promptly potted it. "Sorry,"
  he added almost before the ball was in the pocket.</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:33%;">
      <a href="images/046-2.png"><img width="100%" src="images/046-2.png"
      alt="" /></a>
    <p>A MASTERLY TEN-SHOT, WHICH COLLECTED ALL THREE BALLS IN THE BOTTOM
    RIGHT-HAND POCKET.</p>

    <p>[The continuous line shows the path of the striker's ball and the
    dotted lines those of the object balls.]</p>
  </div>
  <p>For some time after this episode, <span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page48" id="page48"></a>[pg 48]</span> which chilled the atmosphere
  a trifle, the exchanges were uneventful. A slight tendency towards
  "barracking" on the part of the crowd was quickly stifled, however, by a
  brilliant effort from James, who by means of all-round play built up an
  attractive break of 5.</p>

  <p>Herbert at once responded by taking off his coat, but for several
  innings contributed nothing else of note except a powerful shot which
  pocketed the red ball in the fireplace. After an agreement had at last
  been reached about the rule governing this particular class of stroke,
  both players settled down to their work and put in some useful breaks,
  runs of 3, 7 and 4 by James being countered by 2, 5, 6 and 3 (twice) by
  Herbert. The latter was the first to reach the 50-mark, an event which
  the crowd signalised by hanging up their hats and advancing to the table.
  When they were informed that the game was one of a hundred up, they
  seemed disposed to argue the matter, and from this stage their attitude
  towards the players became openly and impartially critical.</p>

  <p>The latter half of the match was marked by a somewhat peculiar
  incident. With the game standing at 75 all Herbert made a stroke that
  left the red hovering on the brink of a pocket. He waited anxiously, but
  with no result. At this point one of the crowd emitted a prodigious yawn,
  and it was the intense vibration set up from this act, so James declared,
  that induced the ball to topple over into the pocket. In support of his
  contention that no score should ensue he pointed to a framed copy of the
  Rules of Billiards on the wall that balanced a coloured advertisement of
  Tommy Dodd whisky, and recited the rule on vibration. Herbert strenuously
  denied that any such phenomenon had taken place, and when James appealed
  to its author he was met with such an outburst of elephantine sarcasm
  that he refrained from further contesting the point.</p>

  <p>After this the luck of the play went against James, and when, the
  marker having by now finished his meal, the score was actually called at
  90-99 in his opponent's favour, he might have been excused for giving up
  the game as lost. With dogged determination, however, he faced the
  situation. His own ball was somewhere near the centre, the red about
  eighteen inches from the top left-hand pocket, and the white midway
  between the right-hand cushion and the D. With an almost superhuman
  stroke (but <i>not</i>, as was subsequently averred, with his eyes shut)
  he smote the red, and his ball travelled rapidly up and down the table.
  On the down journey it glanced off the white, after which, still going at
  a tremendous pace, it made a complete tour of the table and concluded its
  meteoric career in the bottom right-hand pocket. Meanwhile the red and
  the white had both departed on voyages of their own, the terminus in each
  case being the self-same pocket. (<i>See diagram.</i>) After the balls
  had been taken out, examined and counted, and James's person had been
  searched to see if he were concealing any, the marker pronounced this to
  be a 10-shot, and the game was thus strikingly ended in James's
  favour.</p>

<h2>MY DÉBUT IN "PUNCH."</h2>

  <p>I am, I hope, decently modest. When I said so once to Margery she
  remarked that there was no need to make a virtue of necessity. But
  younger sisters, of course...</p>

  <p>I came down to breakfast at my usual time&mdash;as the others were
  finishing&mdash;and found a letter awaiting me. I opened it under the
  usual fire of insults from Margery and John. To-day I ignored them,
  however, and my young heart gave a small jump. I am a modest young
  man.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter with you, little Sunbeam?" asked John (he is
  Cecilia's husband, through no fault of mine). "Is the tailor more rude
  than usual, or has she found out your address?"</p>

  <p>"The Vicar has asked him to sing at the Band of Hope," suggested
  Margery.</p>

  <p>I commenced my breakfast.</p>

  <p>"What is it, Alan?" asked Cecilia.</p>

  <p>"Oh, nothing," I said easily. "The proof of a thing of mine that
  <i>Punch</i> has accepted."</p>

  <p>They hadn't a word to say for a few seconds, then Margery
  began:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Poor old dear, it must be some awful mistake."</p>

  <p>I ignored Margery.</p>

  <p>"But, Alan darling, how beautiful! You've been trying for years and
  years and now at last it has happened. I <i>do</i> hope it isn't a
  mistake," said Cecilia anxiously. She was trying to be nice, you know.
  I'm sure she was. I went on with my breakfast.</p>

  <p>"Well, John," said Cecilia, "can't you congratulate him, or are you
  too jealous?"</p>

  <p>John sighed deeply and pondered.</p>

  <p>"Terrible how <i>Punch</i> has gone down since our young days, isn't
  it?" he said heavily.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>I spent a miserable time until it appeared. Somehow or other Cecilia
  let the great glad news get about the village. Farley, our newsagent and
  tobacconist, held me when I went in for an ounce of the usual mild.</p>

  <p>"So I 'ear you've 'ad a article printed by this 'ere <i>Punch</i>,
  Sir," he said. "Somethink laughable it'd be, I suppose like, eh?"</p>

  <p>"Not half," I said, striving hard to impersonate a successful
  humourist.</p>

  <p>"Ah, well, it's all good for business," he said, as one who sees the
  silver lining. "I've 'ad quite a number of orders for the paper for the
  next two or three weeks."</p>

  <p>I crept from the shop, only to meet an atrocious woman from "The
  Gables," who stopped me with a little shriek of joy.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Mr. Jarvis, I've been dying to meet you, do you know. I always
  have thought you so funny, ever since that little sketch you got up for
  the Bazaar last summer. I said to my husband when I heard of your
  success, '<i>I'm</i> not surprised. After that sketch, <i>I knew</i>.'
  <i>Do</i> tell me when it's appearing. I'm sure I shall simply scream at
  it."</p>

  <p>I escaped after a time and wondered whether it was too late to stop
  publication of the horrible thing.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>I came down to breakfast and found John with a copy beside him. I
  looked at him.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said, "the worst has happened. It is in print. We have been
  waiting for you to appear."</p>

  <p>He turned the pages and cleared his throat.</p>

  <p>"I shall now read the article aloud," he said. "Each time I raise my
  hand the audience will please burst into hearty laughter."</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page50" id="page50"></a>[pg 50]</span>

  <p>Margery giggled.</p>

  <p>"Cecilia," I said, rising, "if you don't control this reptile that you
  have married, if you don't force him to hold his peace, if you allow him
  to read one word, I'll throw the bread-knife at him and ... and pour my
  coffee all over the tablecloth."</p>

  <p>"John," said Cecilia, "have a little thought for others and read it
  quietly to yourself."</p>

  <p>Cecilia meant well, of course, but Margery giggled again.</p>

  <p>John read it to himself in a dead silence, sighed heavily and passed
  it to Margery.</p>

  <p>"We shall never live it down," he said, putting his head into his
  hands and gazing moodily at the marmalade.</p>

  <p>Margery read it and giggled three or four times; but Margery giggles
  at anything.</p>

  <p>Cecilia read it and beamed.</p>

  <p>"Alan, dear," she said, "it's lovely! Of <i>course</i> they accepted
  it. John, you wretch, say you liked it." (Cecilia can be a dear.)</p>

  <p>"Well, if I must tell the truth," said John, "it isn't quite so bad as
  I expected. In fact I very much doubt whether he wrote it at all. If he
  did&mdash;well, it's a marvellous fluke, that's all."</p>

  <p>I smiled.</p>

  <p>"You may smile, swelled-head," said John; "but I'll bet you five
  golden guineas to a bad tanner you couldn't do it again."</p>

  <p>"Done," I said.</p>

  <p>After a few days, however, I realised that I had made a mistake. Even
  a bad sixpence is worth something nowadays.</p>

  <p>Cecilia and Margery vied with each other in offering me the feeblest
  suggestions for articles that they felt sure would reduce a rhinoceros to
  hysterics. John presented me with a copy of <i>A Thousand and One Jokes
  and Anecdotes</i> "to prove he was a sportsman," he said. I started to
  look for a bad sixpence.</p>

  <p>Then Margery said to me:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Why don't you write and explain the whole thing to the Editor and
  offer to go halves if he prints it?"</p>

  <p>I looked at her in amazement.</p>

  <p>"You horrible little cheat!" I said.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>However, on thinking it over carefully there seems a lot to say for
  the idea and it's really quite fair. Anyhow I can't possibly let John
  win. So here's the story, and with any luck it will cost John five golden
  guineas. But I shan't give the Editor half.</p>

<h2>THE BURIAL OF DUNDEE.</h2>

  <p>"Dundee is dead," said my wife, returning from her morning visit to
  the kitchen.</p>

  <p>"I am very sorry to hear it," I replied, laying down the newspaper on
  the breakfast-table, at which I still lingered; and indeed I was sorry.
  Dundee had been our household cat from the earliest days of our married
  life, from the time when he was a tiny kitten the colour of marmalade,
  which had earned him his name.</p>

  <p>"Cook is very much upset," my wife continued.</p>

  <p>"Her distress does her credit," I answered.</p>

  <p>"She talks of leaving."</p>

  <p>I must confess with shame that a pang acuter than the first went
  through me at the news, for Cook was one of those rare artists who
  understands the value of surprise and never rides success to death.</p>

  <p>"Ask her to reconsider her decision," I said.</p>

  <p>"I have," said my wife, "and she remained immovable."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps when the first shock has worn off?"</p>

  <p>"There is just a chance."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I am sure you can persuade her," I concluded, preparing to leave
  for my office.</p>

  <p>"Before you go," interrupted my wife, "what are we going to do about
  the burial?"</p>

  <p>"How does one usually dispose of dead cats?" I asked. "I thought the
  dustman&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Out of the question."</p>

  <p>"I know it is forbidden by the by-laws of the Corporation, but a
  shilling&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"How stupid you are! If anything were to decide Cook to go it would be
  handing over Dundee's remains to the dustman. You know how particular
  Cook is about funerals."</p>

  <p>I knew indeed. The rate of mortality among her friends and relations
  was abnormally high, and on account, as I suspect, of her skill in
  cookery she was in frequent demand as a mourner. By continual attendance
  she had cultivated a nice sense of what was fitting on these occasions
  and posed as an authority on the subject.</p>

  <p>"Very well, then, let's have him buried," I said.</p>

  <p>"Where?"</p>

  <p>"In our garden."</p>

  <p>"Who by?"</p>

  <p>"Palmer or Emily."</p>

  <p>Palmer and Emily are respectively the parlour- and house-maid.</p>

  <p>"Both would say it was not the work for which they were engaged. They
  would leave at the same time as Cook, if I asked them."</p>

  <p>"Who else can we get?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Yourself," my wife made answer.</p>

  <p>"Me? But I can't be seen by all the street burying a cat." I should
  explain that our only garden is in front of the house.</p>

  <p>"If you wait till it is dark you needn't be afraid of anyone seeing
  you," protested my wife.</p>

  <p>"And run the risk of being detected by some suspicious policeman. No,
  thank you."</p>

  <p>"Then if you won't do it yourself you must find someone who will. It
  is our last hope of persuading Cook to stay."</p>

  <p>"By heaven!" I cried, looking at <span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page54" id="page54"></a>[pg 54]</span> my watch, I am a
  quarter-of-an-hour late. I must run."</p>

  <p>This was my customary device to evade the embarrassing dilemmas which
  my wife not infrequently thrust upon me at this hour. So for the moment I
  escaped. All day in the office I was fully occupied. From time to time
  the memory of Dundee lying stark in the basement obtruded itself upon my
  thoughts, but I dismissed the vision as one does a problem one has not
  the courage to face.</p>

  <p>The problem remained unsolved when I stepped out of the train on my
  return from the City. To gain time for reflection I resolved to make a
  détour. As I struck into an unfamiliar side street, I looked up, and
  there in front of me stood an undertaker's shop.</p>

  <p>The inspiration! I entered. From the back premises advanced to meet me
  the undertaker, with a visage tentatively wobegone, not yet knowing
  whether I was widower, orphan, businesslike executor or merely the
  busybody family friend. I unfolded my difficulty. Beneath the outer crust
  of professional melancholy there evidently seethed within the undertaker
  a lava of joviality.</p>

  <p>"Certainly, Sir, certainly," he said. "It is not perhaps strictly in
  my line, but one of my assistants will be delighted to earn an extra
  shilling or so by obliging you. What name and address?"</p>

  <p>I joyfully gave both and made my way home.</p>

  <p>Midway through dinner came a ring at the front-door bell. Palmer
  interrupted her service to answer, and returned to me with a card on a
  salver.</p>

  <p>"A gentleman to see you, Sir," she announced.</p>

  <p>"How strange, at this hour! Who can it be?" asked my wife.</p>

  <p>"The gentleman to bury Dundee," I explained in a lowered voice, as I
  passed the visiting-card, deeply edged with black, across the table to
  her.</p>

  <p>Next morning my wife was able to announce that Cook had consented to
  stay. The burial of Dundee by a real undertaker had gratified her sense
  of the correct. I departed to the City filled with self-complacency.</p>

  <p>For a month I dwelt in this fool's paradise. Then one evening my wife
  gently broke the news.</p>

  <p>"I have something serious to tell you. Cook has given notice."</p>

  <p>"Who is dead now?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"No one. She is engaged to be married."</p>

  <p>"Married?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, to the young undertaker."</p>

  <p>"What young undertaker?"</p>

  <p>"The one who buried Dundee."</p>

  <p>It was too true. At supper, after the inhumation, a mutual esteem had
  sprung up that rapidly ripened into love. The enterprising young
  journeyman, so enamoured of his calling that he consented to inter dumb
  creatures in his leisure time, had evidently discerned in Cook, with her
  wealth of funeral lore, a helpmeet worthy of himself; while Cook on her
  side, conquered by his diligence and discretion, considered she had
  secured a respectable settlement for life, with the prospect of obsequies
  of the highest class for herself.</p>

<h3>CLERICAL EDUCATION.</h3>

  <p>[The Rev. <font class="sc">Kennedy Bell</font>, in <i>The Daily
  Sketch</i>, deplores the dreariness of parish magazines and suggests,
  with a view to brighten their contents, that clergymen should serve an
  apprenticeship on the daily Press.]</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>The Reverend Mr. <font class="sc">Kennedy Bell</font></p>
      <p>Is wholly unable to say all's well</p>
      <p>With the state of our parish magazines,</p>
      <p>And is moved to indicate the means</p>
      <p>Of making their pages bright and snappy</p>
      <p>And bored subscribers cheerful and happy.</p>
      <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page55" id="page55"></a>[pg 55]</span></p>
      <p>Now the most original of his hints</p>
      <p>For galvanizing these dreary prints</p>
      <p>Is this: That every parson, before</p>
      <p>He aspires to be parish editor,</p>
      <p>Should join the staff of a leading daily</p>
      <p>And learn to write genially and gaily.</p>
      <p>It may be a counsel of sheer perfection,</p>
      <p>And yet, perhaps, on further reflection,</p>
      <p>We may admit that something is gained</p>
      <p>By the plan of having clergymen trained</p>
      <p>In the very heart of the Street of Ink</p>
      <p>To paint their parish magazines pink.</p>
      <p>So generous laymen may haply decide</p>
      <p>That it <i>may</i> be worth their while to provide</p>
      <p>Each <font class="sc">Kennedy Bell</font> with stepping-stones</p>
      <p>To rise to the height of a <font class="sc">Kennedy Jones.</font></p>
      <p>But others, a small and dwindling crew,</p>
      <p>Possibly fit, but certainly few,</p>
      <p>And cursed with a most pronounced capacity</p>
      <p>For suffering from inept vivacity,</p>
      <p>Would gladly be reckoned as unenlightened</p>
      <p>Could they keep one class of journal un-"brightened."</p>

<h3>THE PASSING OF THE LITTER.</h3>

  <p>It happened only a couple of weeks ago, but the horrible memory comes
  back to me as if it only happened yesterday. It was my own fault, because
  with a telephone loose about the place one ought not to encourage other
  pets.</p>

  <p>"Well," I said to Sibyl, "there we are, and we must make the best of
  them."</p>

  <p>Sibyl sniffed as she usually does when these periodical occurences
  happen in our house.</p>

  <p>"Which of them are you going to keep?" she asked, "and is it really
  necessary to keep any of them?"</p>

  <p>"Well," I said; "but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What I mean to say," said Sibyl, "better do away with them when they
  are quite young. It would be far more humane."</p>

  <p>"I am with you up to a point," I said; "I admit they are not a very
  prepossessing lot."</p>

  <p>"How they came to be born at all is what I cannot understand," said
  Sibyl, who is always like that when trying to be serious.</p>

  <p>"Well," I said, "I have decided to keep one of them&mdash;No. 1."</p>

  <p>"But surely," said Sibyl, "that the most delicate one of the lot."</p>

  <p>That, I well knew, was quite true. Whether I should ever rear No. 1
  was a matter for time to prove. It was so delicate that once or twice
  already it had been on the verge of collapse, but I had rallied it each
  time.</p>

  <p>"As for the others," I said, "we shall have to get rid of them."</p>

  <p>I need not go into painful details, but the thing was easily done.
  That very evening, unfortunately, through an oversight, No. 1 perished
  also.</p>

  <p>For this I blame McWhirter.</p>

  <p>"The number of my bus is 21," he said in the theatre buffet that
  night; "by the way what's yours?"</p>

  <p>"Whisky," I said absent-mindedly, "and not much soda."</p>

  <p>And it was only after I had drunk it that I realised my error. It was
  then too late.</p>

  <p>And that is how New Year Resolution No. 1&mdash;the most delicate of
  the litter&mdash;passed away at the early age of one week.</p>

<h3>SHAKSPEARE THE TRADUCER.</h3>

  <p>The members of the League of Scottish Veterans of the World War met
  recently in New York, and after "due deliberation" (<i>Query</i>, Can
  Scotchmen deliberate "duly" in New York now?) passed a resolution
  demanding that <font class="sc">Shakspeare's</font> tragedy,
  <i>Macbeth</i>, be removed from the curriculum of English literature
  studies in American schools.</p>

  <p>Apparently this was an example of "dry" Scotch humour. A neighbouring
  city had previously banned <i>The Merchant of Venice</i> from its schools
  on the ground that the character of <i>Shylock</i> was a libel on the
  Jewish race. If Jewish children no longer had to pay for school editions
  of <i>The Merchant of Venice</i> should Scottish infants still have to
  squander their bawbees on a play that insulted their forbears? Perish the
  thought! "We consider," they declared, "that if a Jewish gabardine is to
  be cleaned by American Boards of Education the stain should likewise be
  removed from the Scottish kilt." And if there are no reliable cleaners in
  the U.S.A. it should be sent to Perth.</p>

  <p>The example thus nobly set is being widely followed. The members of
  the Southern Jazz-band Union met yesterday way down in Tennessee, and
  passed a resolution demanding the elimination of <i>Othello</i> from the
  educational curriculum. The proposer declared with some heat that "no
  coloured gentleman would spifflicate his missus wid a bolster on de word
  of a mean white thief like dat <i>Iago</i>." The mere suggestion was dam
  foolishness and an insult to the most prominent section of the freeborn
  citizens of the U.S.A. "If dey gwine whitewash de Scotchman, why not de
  man ob colour too?"</p>

  <p>At a representative meeting of Welshmen Mr. Jones ap Jones moved that,
  as a protest against <font class="sc">Shakspeare's</font> treatment of
  <i>Fluellen</i> and the Cymric vegetable symbol, <i>Henry V.</i> "be no
  longer taught in Welsh schools or read at Jesus College, Oxford,
  whateffer."</p>

  <p>At a recent meeting of the S.P.R. it was proposed by Sir A. <font
  class="sc">Conan Doyle</font>, of Oliver Lodge, Ether, Surrey, "that the
  Board of Education be asked, in the interests of scientific truth, to
  suspend the teaching of <i>Hamlet</i> until the scenes in which the
  <i>Ghost</i> appears shall have been emended in the light of modern
  research by a committee of psychical experts appointed for the purpose.
  The proposer quoted the line spoken by <i>Hamlet</i> to the
  apparition:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,"</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>and said he would like to substitute for it, "Be thou a subjective
  hallucination arising from an uprush of inhibited emotional disturbance
  from the subliminal consciousness, or the objectivisation of a telepathic
  communication from the extra-corporeal sphere of being, or, finally, a
  manifestation to sensory perception of some supra-normal undulatory
  movement of the ether."</p>

  <p>He had always deprecated, he said, the meddling of untrained amateurs
  with the details of psychic phenomena, and felt that the rule should be
  made retrospective. An amendment was carried to add <i>Julius Cæsar</i>
  and <i>Richard III.</i> to the motion for similar reasons.</p>

  <p>The Labour Party have decided to ask Mr. <font
  class="sc">Fisher</font> to ban <i>Coriolanus</i> on the ground that many
  of the speeches of the chief character betray an anti-democratic bias,
  out of keeping with the ideals that should be set before the rising
  generation. Phrases like "The mutable rank-scented many," applied to the
  proletariat, could only foster the bourgeois prejudices of jaundiced
  reactionaries and teach the young scions of the capitalist classes to
  look down upon the manual worker.</p>

      <p><font class="sc">Porta</font>, the once notorious Michigander,</p>
      <p>Who launched the now exploded solar slander,</p>
      <p>Whereat ten thousand negroes stood aghast,</p>
      <p>In one short month into oblivion passed,</p>
      <p>But <font class="sc">Pickering's</font> momentous lunar screed</p>
      <p>Proves the persistence of this wondrous breed.</p>
      <p>Yet this in <font class="sc">Pickering's</font> favour let us state:</p>
      <p>He has no scare or scandal to relate&mdash;</p>
      <p>Nothing in any way that may impugn</p>
      <p>The credit or the morals of the moon;</p>
      <p>And on the other hand it does attract us</p>

      <p>Which nursery rhymers (banned by <font class="sc">Montessori</font>)</p>
      <p>Associated with the lunar story.</p>
      <p>Still <font class="sc">Pickering's</font> vegetable views are tame</p>
      <p>Contrasted with Professor <font class="sc">Goddard's</font> aim;</p>
      <p>For he, as from the daily Press we learn,</p>
      <p>An obvious plagiarist of good <font class="sc">Jules Verne</font>,</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks</i>.)</p>

  <p><i>From Friend to Friend</i> (<font class="sc">Murray</font>) is the
  name given, from the first of them, to a collection of eight fugitive
  papers, prepared for republication by the late Lady <font
  class="sc">Ritchie</font> during the last months of her life, and now
  edited by her sister-in-law, Miss <font class="sc">Emily Ritchie</font>.
  Fugitive though they may have been in original intent, these pages are so
  filled with their writer's delicate and very personal charm that her
  lovers will be delighted to have their flight thus pleasantly arrested.
  Lady <font class="sc">Ritchie</font> was above all else the perfect
  appreciator. <i>Horas non numerat nisi serenas</i>; the gaze that she
  turns smilingly upon old happy far-off days looks through spectacles
  rose-tinted both by the magic of retrospect and her own genius for
  admiration. London, Freshwater, Paris, Rome&mdash;these are the settings
  of her memories; and we see them all by a light that (perhaps) never was
  on land or sea, in whose radiance beauty and wit and genius move
  wonderfully to a perpetual music. In truth, however, these eminent
  Victorians of Lady <font class="sc">Ritchie's</font> circle must have
  been a rare company; I have no space for even a catalogue of
  them&mdash;Mrs. <font class="sc">Cameron</font>, with her vague
  magnificence, pouring letters and an embarrassment of gifts upon her dear
  <font class="sc">Tennysons</font>; the <font class="sc">Kemble</font>
  sisters, <font class="sc">Lockhart, Thackeray</font> himself, a score of
  great and (to the kindly chronicler) gracious personalities live again in
  her pages. I should add that the volume is rounded off by a short story,
  a late addition to the <i>Miss Williamson</i> series, which might be
  called a pot-boiler, were it not somehow incongruous to associate so
  gentle a flame with any such activities. Slight as it is, <i>From Friend
  to Friend</i> forms an apt and graceful finish to the work of one whose
  life was given to the claims of friendship.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p><i>Fanny goes to War</i> (<font class="sc">Murray</font>) should be
  read by those who also went and those who didn't. It is a chronicle of
  the adventures of the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry in Belgium and
  France&mdash;vivid; inviting wonder, laughter and sometimes tears; fresh
  and delicious. The account of the first visit to the trenches awakens
  memories. Viewed from this distance it seems all to have been so
  picturesque, such fun! The humour of Thomas, the intelligence and tact of
  the good French <i>poilu</i>, the awful moments and the wild jests in
  between&mdash;these are all shown. The splendid humour with which "<font
  class="sc">Pat Beauchamp</font>," the author, bravely endured her own
  casualty with its distressing effects is typical in itself of that spirit
  in the Anglo-Saxon race which made the Teuton race wish it hadn't. In my
  view, the <i>obiter dictum</i> of an anonymous Colonel sums up the values
  of this ladies' contingent better than does the preface of the
  distinguished Major-General: "Neither fish, flesh nor fowl," said the
  Colonel on having the constitution of this anomalous unit explained to
  him, "but thundering good red herring!" Time was, I believe and hope,
  when I myself, passing through the Base Port on leave and being full of
  life and daring, have sighted a lady-chauffeur of a motor-ambulance and
  have thrown a friendly glance, even a froward smile, at her. Waiving all
  questions of propriety, I hope that this was so, and that the
  lady-chauffeur was no less than "<font class="sc">Pat Beauchamp</font>"
  herself, in the later stages of her career overseas. Though her only
  response may have <span class="pagenum"><a name="page60"
  id="page60"></a>[pg 60]</span> been to splash mud over me, I should feel
  happy, now, thus to have paid my respects to this gallant and
  high-spirited lady. I count myself among the company, battalion,
  division, corps and army of her admirers.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>It certainly does not seem eight years, yet it must be fully that,
  since <font class="sc">Joseph Conrad</font> in <i>The English Review</i>
  lifted a veil that lay between his admirers and an interesting
  personality with the pleasantly discursive papers which form the basis of
  the re-issued <i>A Personal Record</i> (<font class="sc">Dent</font>).
  Between then and now <i>Chance</i>, that masterly but difficult book, has
  by a curious freak of public taste given Mr. <font
  class="sc">Conrad</font>, hitherto the well-loved favourite of the
  relatively few, a much wider constituency. To these late comers, rather
  than to the older (and of course superior) Conradists, who know it
  already, let me recommend this rambling, which is by no means to say
  aimless, account of the wanderings of the MS. of <i>Almayer's Folly</i>,
  some queer entertaining scraps of the author's family history, a
  description of the encounters with the original <i>Almayer</i>, and those
  vignettes of Marseilles which obviously were used as the background of
  <i>The Arrow of Gold</i>. This record is one of those quiet friendly
  books that flatter the devotee by a sense of peculiar intimacy with his
  hero. It is also engagingly characteristic. Mr. <font
  class="sc">Conrad</font> here unravels the fine threads of his personal
  history and philosophy with the same artful reserve and exquisite
  elaboration with which he evolves the creatures of his resourceful
  imagination.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p><i>The Life of Liza Lehmann</i> (<font class="sc">Unwin</font>),
  written by herself, and finished, as her husband tells in a pathetic
  foot-note, "scarcely two weeks before her death," is a book holding many
  special bonds of association with <i>Punch</i>, not least the fact that
  her father-in-law, Deputy <font class="sc">J.T. Bedford</font>, was the
  author of that <i>Robert, the City Waiter</i>, who was among the most
  famous and popular of Mr. Punch's early creations. The volume that the
  writer has put together is the record of a busy, successful and, on the
  whole, happy life, passed in the company of interesting people, about
  many of whom Madame <font class="sc">Lehmann</font> has remembered some
  entertaining story. Chiefly, as is natural, the persons recorded are the
  musical folk of the last half-century, from <font class="sc">Jenny
  Lind</font> to Sir <font class="sc">Thomas Beecham</font>; though in the
  allied Arts I was taken by a pleasing and new anecdote of <font
  class="sc">Robert Browning</font> reciting <i>How they Brought the Good
  News</i> into an Edison phonograph, and overcome by loss of memory
  halfway through the ordeal. One wonders if this rather surprising record
  exists to-day. I am not going to assert that the non-technical reader may
  not find the pages devoted to reprinted criticism rather over-numerous;
  old newspaper files, like old theatrical photographs, too quickly fade.
  But the author's humour endured; and I like to think that she could
  appreciate a joke made at her own expense; witness her quotation from the
  gushing friend who, at the moment of the first triumph of <i>The Persian
  Garden</i>, overwhelmed the composer with the tribute, "<i>Do</i> let me
  thank you! The local colour is <i>too</i> wonderful. I simply felt <i>as
  if I was at Liberty's</i>!"</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>To the jaded reader I recommend <i>The Road to En-Dor</i> (<font
  class="sc">Lane</font>) as a book which should undoubtedly stir him up.
  It is the most extraordinary war-tale which has come my way. With such
  material as he had to his hand Lieutenant <font class="sc">E.H.
  Jones</font> would have been a sad muddler if he had not made his story
  intriguing; but, anyhow, he happens to be a sound craftsman with a
  considerable sense of style and construction. And he has a convincing way
  of handling his facts that compels belief in the most incredible of
  stories. Lieutenant <font class="sc">Jones</font> was a prisoner in the
  hands of the Turks at Zozgad, and to amuse himself and his
  fellow-prisoners he raised a "spook" which in time gained such a
  reputation that it had the Turkish officials almost hopelessly at its
  mercy. From being merely a joke his spook soon began to suggest, to him a
  way of escaping from the camp, and then, in conjunction with Lieutenant
  <font class="sc">C.W. Hill</font>, he worked it for all it was worth. His
  record of their adventures and of the sufferings, physical and mental,
  which they had to face is really astounding; but I fear it will be
  received coldly by the psychist. Spiritualism, indeed, is treated with
  scant respect, and whatever our own view of this vexed subject may be
  most of us will admit that Lieutenant <font class="sc">Jones</font> has
  considerable reason for his strong opinion.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>In <i>The Green Shoes of April</i> (<font class="sc">Hurst and
  Blackett</font>) Miss <font class="sc">Rachel Swete Macnamara</font> has
  got together quite a lot of people and situations that other novelists
  have used before. There is the fine young Irishman soldiering in India,
  the soulless actress who marries and leaves him, and the splendid Irish
  girl, his true mate, whom he weds in happy ignorance of his first
  partner's continued existence. But the hero has a maiden aunt, with a
  story of her own, and the heroine a terrific grandmother who are Miss
  <font class="sc">Macnamara's</font> creations, and as she makes wife
  number one lie like a trooper in order to preserve the happiness of wife
  number two a <i>soupçon</i> of freshness is imparted to the
  <i>réchauffé</i>. Of course the well-meaning first wife is not allowed to
  succeed in her efforts, and <i>Beau</i> and <i>Perry</i> (you would never
  guess from that which was which, but in this case it doesn't matter) have
  a very bad time indeed until, reassured by a friendly barrister, they
  settle down again into wedded happiness. These are the confiding souls
  whom novelists and lawyers love, and I can see Miss <font
  class="sc">Macnamara</font>, by-and-by, getting quite a nice story out of
  someone's attempt to oust their eldest son from his inheritance. I hope
  she will.</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
